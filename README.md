# Animated Sparse Voxel Octrees


## Introduction

Animated Sparse Voxel Octrees (ASVO) is an animation technique for sparse voxel octrees. It allows you to apply rigid transformations or skinning to voxel based 3D models.

You can find more detailed information on the [project page](http://bautembach.de/wordpress/?page_id=7).

This is the C# version of the project used for data structure- and algorithm design as well as prototyping purposes. Among other things, it contains a software rasterzier to render '.asvo' models.


## Dependencies

- [Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=23714)
- [XNAnimation Library](http://xnanimation.codeplex.com/): This project contains a ported version of XNAnimation 0.7.0.0 BETA 3 to support XNA 4.0. Please use this copy as it contains custom changes and ASVO won't work with the official version.
