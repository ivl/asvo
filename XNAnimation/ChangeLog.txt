 - SkinnedModelBasicEffect: Added supports for just one light source.
 
VERSION 0.7.0.0 BETA - CHANGELOG (06/30/2008)
General:
- Improved documentation
- Changed skinned model processor name to "Model - XNAnimation"
- Changed skinned model effect processor name to "Model Material - XNAnimation"
- Skinned model effect processor is now hided

XNAnimation:
- AnimationController: Faster animation update using binary keyframe search
- AnimationController: (bug fixed) Keyframe scale is now correct handled
- AnimationController: Removing exception generate while updating an animation controller before any
  animation clip has started
- AnimationController: (bug fixed) Loads the model's skeleton bind pose when a controller is created
- SkinnedModelEffect: Improved number of supported bones from 58 to 80 (thanks to Jon Watte)
- SkinnedModelEffect: (bug fixed) Properly handles translation on world transformation (thanks bryanedds)
- SkinnedModelEffect: Reports vertex and pixel shader profile
- SkinnedModelEffect: Added Normal Mapping support
- SkinnedModelEffect: Added Specular Mapping support
- Pose: Implements IEquatable, and == and != operators

XNAnimationPipeline:
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added "Split Animation Filename". Uses an XML file to split the model's animations.
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added "Generate Tangent Frame". Generate tangent and binormal vectors for each vertex.
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added "Change Texture Path". Changes the path of all textures.
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added "Change Texture Path Type". Sets if the new texture path is absolute or relative.
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added "Model Rotation". Rotates the model over the Y,X,Z axes.
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added "Model Scaling". Scales the model.
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added ".Dump Hierarchy". (DEBUG) Dumps the model hierarchy
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Added ".Dump Animations". (DEBuG) Dumps de model animations
- SkinnedModelProcessor: "Bake Mesh Transforms" default is now TRUE
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Skips invalid animations inside the model's skeleton
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Skips invalid skeleton nodes inside the model's skeleton
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Skips animation channels that does not affet the model's skeleton
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Warning when processing a mesh child of a bone
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Warning when processing a model without animations
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Throws an exception when processing a geometry without material
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Throws an exception when processing a geometry without blend weights channel
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Throws an exception when the model's skeleton has more than 80 bones
- SkinnedModelProcessor: Throws an exception when the model does not has a skeleton
- SkinnedModelMaterialProcessor: Reads materials properties from the model's materials
- SkinnedModelMaterialProcessor: Reads materials maps from the model's materials using pre-defined keys

VERSION 0.3.0.0 - CHANGELOG (05/26/2008)
- Keyframe data (translation, orientation, and scale) is now stored decomposed for better 
interpolation and low memory footprint.
- Keyframe data (translation, orientation and scale) can be interpolated separately now.
- Added cubic and spherical keyframe interpolation.
- Added cross fade blending between animation clips. Allows smooth transitions between animations.
- Added support for the Xbox 360.
- Preliminary documentation released.
- New sample for Windows and Xbox released.
